# Discontinuation of Project
HeroEngineer.com was a professor's pet project for 3 semesters with over 50 students at USC. It's now discontinued, and the source code is
released for reference if other students want to build on the idea in the future. Also note that HeroEngineer was an experiment requiring rapid prototyping
and feedback, so it doesn't have tests, documentation, or the other niceties you might hope to find in a professional-grade project.
